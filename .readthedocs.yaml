# makeprojects needs doxypypy to build the docs. The version of doxypypy that's
# in pypi.org is outdated, so the most recent version must be pulled from
# github and installed manually.
#
# Since Python 3.9, commonmark, setuptools and distlib have issues so they
# too need to be updated to the latest version to work. Thankfully, they
# simply need to be pulled down using pip without any issues.
